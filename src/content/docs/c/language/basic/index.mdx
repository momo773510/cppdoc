This section provides definitions for the specific terminology and the concepts used when describing the C programming language.

A C program is a sequence of text files (typically header and source files) that contain <Missing>declarations</Missing>. They undergo <Missing>translation</Missing> to become an executable program, which is executed when the OS calls its <Missing>main function</Missing> (unless it is itself the OS or another _freestanding_ program, in which case the entry point is <Behavior kind="impl-def">implementation-defined</Behavior>).

Certain words in a C program have special meaning, they are <Missing>keywords</Missing>. Others can be used as <Missing>identifiers</Missing>, which may be used to identify <Missing>objects</Missing>, <Missing>functions</Missing>, <Missing>struct</Missing>, <Missing>union</Missing>, or <Missing>enumeration</Missing> tags, their members, <Missing>typedef</Missing> names, <Missing>labels</Missing>, or <Missing>macros</Missing>.

Each identifier (other than macro) is only valid within a part of the program called its <Missing>scope</Missing> and belongs to one of four kinds of <Missing>name spaces</Missing>. Some identifiers have <Missing>linkage</Missing> which makes them refer to the same entities when they appear in different scopes or translation units.

Definitions of functions include sequences of <Missing>statements</Missing> and <Missing>declarations</Missing>, some of which include <Missing>expressions</Missing>, which specify the computations to be performed by the program.

<Missing>Declarations</Missing> and <Missing>expressions</Missing> create, destroy, access, and manipulate <Missing>objects</Missing>. Each <Missing>object</Missing>, <Missing>function</Missing>, and <Missing>expression</Missing> in C is associated with a <Missing>type</Missing>.
