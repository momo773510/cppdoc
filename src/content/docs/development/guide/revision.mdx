CppDoc hosts documentation for all historic revisions of the C and C++ programming languages. This guide helps you create CppDoc content for multiple C/C++ revisions while keeping it easily readable by our readers.

## Revision-Specific Spans

### Basic Usage

The `Revision` component renders to an inline-level `<span>` that contains revision-specific content.

```mdx
import { Revision } from "@components/revision";

Some words here.
<Revision since="C++20">This is introduced in C++20.</Revision>
Some more words here.
```

<Card title="Preview">
  Some words here. <Revision since="C++20">This is introduced in C++20.</Revision> Some more words here.
</Card>

The `until` attribute specifies the revision from which the content is removed from the language standard:

```mdx
import { Revision } from "@components/revision";

Some words here.
<Revision until="C++20">This is removed in C++20.</Revision>
Some more words here.
```

<Card title="Preview">
  Some words here. <Revision until="C++20">This is removed in C++20.</Revision> Some more words here.
</Card>

You can specify `since` and `until` attributes simultaneously for content that applies to a range of revisions:

```mdx
import { Revision } from "@components/revision";

Some words here.
<Revision since="C++11" until="C++20">This applies from C++11 to C++17.</Revision>
Some more words here.
```

<Card title="Preview">
  Some words here. <Revision since="C++11" until="C++20">This applies from C++11 to C++17.</Revision> Some more words here.
</Card>

In some context, it may be more fluent to use "removed" rather than "until". You can achieve this by changing the `until` attribute to `removed`:

```mdx
import { Revision } from "@components/revision";

Some words here.
<Revision removed="C++20">This is removed in C++20.</Revision>
Some more words here.
```

<Card title="Preview">
  Some words here. <Revision removed="C++20">This is removed in C++20.</Revision>Some more words here.
</Card>

### Traits

Some content may have _traits_ since a specific revision. For example, a wording may be depracated since a specific revision. Here, "deprecated" is a trait. You can specify arbitrary numbers of traits to the `Revision` component:

```mdx
import { Revision } from "@components/revision";

Some words here.
<Revision
  since="C++11"
  traits={[{ trait: "deprecated", since: "C++17" }]}
>
  This is introduced in C++11 and deprecated since C++17.
</Revision>
Some more words here.
```

<Card title="Preview">
  Some words here.<Revision since="C++11" traits={[{ trait: "deprecated", since: "C++17" }]}>This is introduced in C++11 and deprecated since C++17.</Revision> Some more words here.
</Card>

## Revision-Specific Blocks

The `RevisionBlock` component renders to a block-level `<div>` that contains revision-specific content. Its usage is exactly the same as the `Revision` component.

```mdx
import { RevisionBlock } from "@components/revision";

Some words in this paragraph.

<RevisionBlock since="C++11" until="C++20">
  This paragraph applies from C++11 to C++17.
</RevisionBlock>

<RevisionBlock
  since="C++11"
  traits={[{ trait: "deprecated", since: "C++20" }]}
  removed="C++26"
>
  This paragraph is introduced in C++11, deprecated in C++20, and removed in
  C++26.
</RevisionBlock>

Some more paragraphs.
```

<Card title="Preview">
  Some words in this paragraph.

  <RevisionBlock since="C++11" until="C++20">
    This paragraph applies from C++11 to C++17.
  </RevisionBlock>

  <RevisionBlock
    since="C++11"
    traits={[{ trait: "deprecated", since: "C++20" }]}
    removed="C++26"
  >
    This paragraph is introduced in C++11, deprecated in C++20, and removed in
    C++26.
  </RevisionBlock>

  Some more paragraphs.

## Autorev

CppDoc users could pin CppDoc content to a specific revision by selecting from the dropdown list above the table-of-contents area on each page. For example, if the user selects and pins its view to C++17, it will hide all content that does not apply to C++17.

The `Revision` and the `RevisionBlock` components work out-of-the-box with this feature. Besides, you can opt-in to this feature for arbitrary HTML elements by attaching revision information to them.

### Attach revision info to arbitrary HTML elements

The `autoRev` helper function returns an object that contains a collection of HTML element attributes that, when applied to an HTML element, let autorev show and hide the HTML element according to the selected revision:

```mdx
import { autoRev } from "@components/revision";

<div {...autoRev({ autorevSince: "C++11", autorevUntil: "C++20" })}>
  This div will display only when user selects C++11, C++14, or C++17.
</div>
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Autorev hides an HTML element by adding the CSS class `autorev-hidden` to the element. A default CSS rule is provided to set `display: none` for elements with this class. However, in circumstances where this default CSS rule does not apply due to CSS specificity issues, you should add corresponding CSS rules manually to make sure your element is hidden properly.

### Advanced usage

In rare circumstances you may want to listen for revision changes and perform actions accordingly. This could be achieved by subscribing to the `selectedRevision` [nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) manually:

```astro
---
---

<div>
  Your content here.
</div>

<script>
  import { selectedRevision } from "@components/revision/store";

  selectedRevision.subscribe((rev) => {
    // Do something with the currently selected revision `rev`.
  });
</script>
```
